This repository combines the server side of what's meant to be the 'online' mode for all of my board games.

## Server status

The server is **NOT** deployed yet, if the project get a noticeable audience (which is very unlikely) I will host the server on some cloud service, but I will need some financial support.

Some of you might download the setup zip and use it, but due to security concerns I do not recommend you to use any server other than mine, and I take no responsibility whatsoever for any damage resulting from the latter.

I most likely **will** host it myself to conclude my objectives for the BG project, it's just a matter of time.
